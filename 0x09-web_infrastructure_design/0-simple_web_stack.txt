Weekinesses:

*SPOF: single point of failure, we have here many SPOF (one server, one app server, one database), if one is failed in some point, will lead others to fail as well.

*Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted: when pushing a new version to be uploaded it will affect the endusers who can't see the new version, and it might need a server restart and that the end users will not be able to access the server.

*Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: this type of infrastructure can't scale because it have one server, so when there is a big traffic, probably will shutdown or will increase the load time for end users.
